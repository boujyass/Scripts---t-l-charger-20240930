# OSC Controller Project ReadMe

## Overview

The project consists of three main parts:

- `Controller`: Handles the data received from the OSC server and sends commands to control the game.
- `OSCServer`: Receives OSC messages from a client and forwards them to the appropriate `Controller` methods.
- `main`: Initializes the `Controller` and the `OSCServer`, and starts the server.

In order to run the script, just run the mainTP1.py and STK_input_server and it will work!
